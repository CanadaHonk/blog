*DÃ©jÃ  vu*, huh? I [announced joining Mozilla](/joining-mozilla/) and have been working since October 1st, under a 6 month fixed-term contract. Until now! Today I signed a new offer to become a permanent employee! ðŸŽ‰

### Why does it matter?

- I will continue working on Firefox/Gecko for the foreseeable future!
- My work seems to be important enough for me to continue :^)

### Work (October - December)

As a bonus, here's a detailed recap of significant work I've done since joining (October - December), with some comments/rants (in order of ship date):

- **[User activation API](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1791079)** (Firefox 120)<br>
  This was ~~for once~~ relatively easy/small and probably the simplest API I've added, mostly hooking up the existing internal API to the API as per spec. A good project to start with.

- **[Lazy loading iframes](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1622090)** (Firefox 121)<br>
  This was not like the last. After a ~week of focused development, I had a decent WIP patch. Some refinement later, we now passed most WPTs and I *thought* it was good enough to ship. Even though the end of the 120 release cycle was very close, I decided to push it through on by default as I thought it would be fine *(see: naivety)*. <br> After a (very helpful!) [bug report in Nightly](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860041), I [switched to Nightly only](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860057). Delayed to 121, I [enabled it by default again](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860729) after it was fixed thanks to a [handy patch](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D191750).

- **[`<hr>` in `<select>`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1830909)** (Firefox 122)<br>
  I opened a WIP patch in September before getting hired, so I stopped working on it since then. Some time later, it was agreed it would be good to have so I started working on it again. This kind of spec change seems on the surface really easy - the eventual patch wasn't even that complex (imo) - but it was quite the experience for me (I only blame my unaware past self, everyone else was great):
  - The HTML parser. Code changes were quite simple after some helpful review comments.
  - The toolkit (~desktop UI). Changes were okay, a bit overcomplicated to support styling the `color` of `<hr>s` but understandable.
  - Android. The tiny GeckoView change was incredibly easy on my end, the only problem is **it doesn't work**. Fenix (Firefox for Android)'s menus for `<select>` [do not support separators](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1867045) yet, so nothing renders in the menu. More work is needed there to match desktop completely, but that's okay for now (imo).
  - The spec. You might think (as did I) *"How could the spec be complex? It's just adding if `<hr>` in `<select>`, show separator"*. You're right, that's essentially what [the spec PR](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9124/files) did. However, **no**. Pointed out in a [great comment on the patch](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D189065#6429777) (I would have missed this otherwise, thank review processes), we did weird things when used in a `<select>` with a `size` >1 (~showing part of the dropdown in the element). I checked Blink and WebKit expecting it to be a mistake in my patch, but actually they do the same as my WIP patch did, not render separators. This *feels* wrong, or at least not what I would expect, so eventually [I opened a spec issue for it](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9960) (for now Gecko matches others). Another shoutout to [`<hr>` not being allowed in `<optgroup>`](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9247).
  - The WPT tests. After accidentally finding [some](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1867045) [WebDriver](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1856989) bugs due to Fission (~cross-origin process isolation) not being cooperating, I ended up [marking them as flaky](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D190441), only [passing with Fission off](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D191630). I tried fixing the WD bugs, but ended up more confused than I started (modern browsers are complex indeed).

- **[ICU4X migration work](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1815871)**<br>
  - Let's start by cleaning up older Gecko code to stop using ~deprecated internal Intl APIs.
    - First batter up: [Make XSLT not use sort key objects for collation](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1730119). A [nice small patch](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D192349) replacing old code with a nicer, smaller implementation using newer Intl APIs, yay!
    - Next: [Drop all IDB locale custom support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1730706). [Two](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D192064) [huge](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D192198) patches, removing ~3K lines of code in total. As of writing 1/2 have landed!
  - I also began trying upstream some small [ICU4X](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/) patches:
    - [Expose if a date is in a leap year](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/pull/4273): relatively straight-forward patch to expose an already existing internal API.
    - [Add `is_normalized_up_to` to Normalizer](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/pull/4334): the patch itself is quite nice, but accidentally poked a nest restarting a (now resolved?) debate ðŸ˜…. Update soonâ„¢.

### Entire year recap

For a recap of notable events/contributions/work throughout the entire year:

- Implemented various notable things in Firefox (with ~4x as many random minor fixes):

  - CSS `NaN`/`infinity` fixes + ship (114)
  - `@import supports()` (115)
  - `URL.canParse()` (115)
  - *-- Exams --*
  - `<search>` (118)

  - `<iframe loading=lazy`> (121)
  - `<hr>` in `<select>` (122)
- Did my first conference thing by running a session about my experience being a new contributor to web engines at [Web Engines Hackfest](https://webengineshackfest.org/2023/) (didn't expect today at the time!). I'm not planning to speak or anything this year, but maybe the next?

### Resolutions

- Meet and talk to more people! This is mostly to simply meet cool people (yes that includes you) and also half to improve my own anxiety ;)
- Travel more! I am already planning to attend 2 conferences so far (and probably 2 work things), potentially more?
- Start doing (more) work on standards and other upstream projects like ICU4X
- Get my JS engine into a mostly usable state for basic projects?

Talking with people it still feels.. incredible to say where I work and what I do. I am very privileged to be in my current position and continue to be thankful to everyone who helped me along the way to today. Thanks for reading! I hope 2024 goes well for you :)
