So I started making a browser engine (for fun) a few days ago, it felt kind of inevitable [after starting a JS engine](https://porffor.goose.icu), so here we are. Here's a short rundown. [Source code too!](https://github.com/canadahonk/shadow)

# [Try it in your browser!](https://shadow.goose.icu)

### What?

A browser(/web) engine essentially takes in a URL(/etc) and gives you it rendered into a window for you to view and interact with. Shadow does this too, almost entirely from scratch, made in JS. It runs in your browser! Node backend soonâ„¢ too? The host browser(/etc) is only used for networking (`fetch`) and renderer backend (`<canvas>`).

#### Components of Shadow

### Why make it?

It's just for fun, no really. Learning too. It will probably never work with 90% of websites, and that's okay. ~~Also it's funny to see people react in many forms of "wtf?"~~

Pretty spot on! No list markers yet. Colors are different as UA/browser defined.

### Name

As with all my recent projects, the name is because I thought it was kind of funny at the time. Shadow is named after the defunct &lt;shadow&gt; element. I mostly stole this idea from Blink (was it intentional to name it after a dead HTML element at the time?). Also it sounds spooky and mysterious so that's a bonus I guess?

### It supports JavaScript??!

Yes, kind of. This is quite complicated (as you can probably imagine), so I'll do it in a separate future dedicated post if you're interested (DM/reply me on twitter).

### Why publish it?

Why not? If someone can learn something or just find what I make fun/interesting, that makes me happy :)

### But making a new browser engine is impossible!

[No](https://ladybird.dev). [It](https://servo.org). [Isn't](https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/)! *(Also I don't really care how possible/feasible something is.)*
